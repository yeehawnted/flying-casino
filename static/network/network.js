	Make all datachannel UDP like sendObject or setupDataChannel's async check for sequence to ensure no dropped packets.
	Rearrange NetworkAPI to make the class methods and attributes more readable
	Allow for multiple different games to seperate what is sent to users (likely going to be mainly logic in server.py)
	Allow for ID to remain between connections EX resetting the page. (though, likely apart of game account logic seperately)
	Make sendObject not singular

	To do so: 
		1. Run server.py locally with websockets.serve(handler, "localhost", 8765)
		2. Remove "export" from constructNetworkAPI 
		3. Replace index.html's script with just <script src="network.js"></script>
		4. Run webserver.js, and then go to network.js

	Otherwise, there can be weird bugs with it.
